## 1. Technology Stack
- **React with TypeScript**: I chose this for its type safety and improved development experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: I implemented this for rapid styling and maintaining a consistent design system
- **Vite**: I selected this as the build tool for its fast development and optimized production builds
- **Lucide React**: I used this lightweight icon library because it has appropriate icons for an elementary school

## 2. My Design Approach

### Typography Decisions
In my design, I focused on:
- Using clear, readable fonts through Tailwind's default system font stack

- A mobile-responsive hamburger menu
- Smooth scroll behavior for anchor links
- Simple, child-friendly navigation labels

- Fade-in animations on scroll for engagement
- Subtle hover effects on interactive elements
- Image scale transitions for visual feedback
- Staggered animations using delay timing
